Overview
========
This document provides an overview of the Azure API Management (APIM) service, including its deployment, configuration, and usage.
APIM is a fully managed service that enables organizations to create, publish, secure, and analyze APIs. It acts as a gateway between API consumers and backend services, providing features such as rate limiting, caching, authentication, and monitoring.
Deployment
==========
To deploy an APIM instance, you can use the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or ARM templates. The following steps outline the deployment process using the Azure portal:
1. Navigate to the Azure portal and select "Create a resource".
1. Search for "API Management" and select it from the list of results.
1. Click "Create" and fill in the required information, such as the name, resource group, and pricing tier.
1. Review the settings and click "Create" to deploy the APIM instance.
1. Once the deployment is complete, you can access the APIM instance from the Azure portal.

Deploy apim using bicep
======
```bicep
param apimName string
param location string = resourceGroup().location
param publisherEmail string
param publisherName string
param skuName string = 'Developer_1'
resource apim 'Microsoft.ApiManagement/service@2021-08-01' = {
  name: apimName
  location: location
  sku: {
	name: skuName
	capacity: 1
  }
  properties: {
	publisherEmail: publisherEmail
	publisherName: publisherName
	enableClientCertificate: false
  }
}
```

<!-- Provide steps for use and deploy APIM via DevOps pipeline-->
1. Create a new Azure DevOps pipeline or use an existing one.
2. Add a task to install the Azure CLI or use the Azure PowerShell task.
3. Use the Azure CLI or PowerShell commands to deploy the Bicep template. For example:
   ```bash
   az deployment group create --resource-group <your-resource-group> --template-file <path-to-your-bicep-file>
   ```
4. Save and run the pipeline to deploy the APIM instance.


Manual Deployment
================
1. follow the documentation https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/import-container-app-with-oas
1. After deploying the APIM instance, you can configure it by adding APIs, products, and policies. The following steps outline the configuration process:
2. Navigate to the APIM instance in the Azure portal.
3. Click on "APIs" in the left-hand menu and select "Add API" to add a new API. You can import an API from various sources, such as OpenAPI, WSDL, or Azure Functions.
4. Once the API is added, you can configure its settings, such as the URL, operations, and security.
5. Next, click on "Products" in the left-hand menu and select "Add Product" to create a new product. Products are used to group APIs and manage access to them.
